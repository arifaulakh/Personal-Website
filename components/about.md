I'm currently an undergrad at the University of Toronto studying math, computer science and history. Previously, I've built NLP solutions for e-commerce at [<ins>**OpenStore**</ins>](https://open.store) (backed by Founders Fund, General Catalyst, Lux Capital and Khosla Ventures) and dabbled in infrastructure  and front-end projects at **Microsoft**.




<!-- ### What I'm interested in at the moment:

  * Machine learning (specifically in the areas of NLP, ML infrastructure and MLOps)
  * Building the best e-commerce experiences for consumers (inspired by some of the work I did at OpenStore)


### My goals for 2023:

  * Run a half-marathon
  * Read 20 books
  * Publish my writings weekly -->
