I'm a software engineer in NYC building in the embedded payroll space at [<ins>**Check**</ins>](https://checkhq.com).

I recently completed my undergrad at the University of Toronto studying math, computer science and history. Previously, I've built NLP applications for e-commerce at [<ins>**OpenStore**</ins>](https://open.store) and dabbled in infrastructure  and front-end projects at **Microsoft**.

In my free time, I enjoy travelling, listening to podcasts (my favorites are [<ins>**Invest Like The Best**</ins>](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/invest-like-the-best-with-patrick-oshaughnessy/id1154105909) and [<ins>**Acquired**</ins>](https://www.acquired.fm/)), trying new foods and restaurants, playing squash and basketball, watching the NFL, and chilling with my friends.  I hope to start publishing some blog posts in the near future.


### What I'm interested in learning about at the moment:

  * Embedded fintech
  * Developer infrastructure (specifically tooling for LLM deployment and evaluation)
  * Vertical software businesses


### My goals for 2024:
  * Running a half marathon
  * Reading more fiction
  * Writing on a regular cadence
