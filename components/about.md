I'm currently an undergrad at the University of Toronto studying math, computer science and history. Previously, I've built NLP applications for e-commerce at [<ins>**OpenStore**</ins>](https://open.store) (backed by Founders Fund, General Catalyst, Lux Capital and Khosla Ventures) and dabbled in infrastructure  and front-end projects at **Microsoft**.

In my free time, I enjoy travelling, listening to podcasts (my favorites are [<ins>**Invest Like The Best**</ins>](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/invest-like-the-best-with-patrick-oshaughnessy/id1154105909) and [<ins>**Acquired**</ins>](https://www.acquired.fm/)), trying new foods and restaurants, playing squash and scrabble, watching the NFL, and chilling with my friends. 
I hope to start publishing some blog posts in the near future.


### What I'm interested in at the moment:

  * Machine learning (specifically in the areas of NLP, ML infrastructure and MLOps)
  * Sports analytics (using data-driving and computer vision-based approaches to better understand basketball and football strategy)


### My goals for 2023:

  * Run a half-marathon
  * Read 20 books
  * Publish my writings regularly
